Description: Quickly serialize R objects with high comopression using a custom 
    serialization framework.  Lossless transformation is performed on
    atomic types making them easier to compress; this means that compression
    can be better and faster than built-in methods.  This package includes
    an implementation of the floating-point compression algorithm described
    in <doi:10.1145/3626717>.
